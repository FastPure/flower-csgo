# Decided to make it public since it doesn't have anything special. It was a project that i wrote up about 1 year or so ago.
UD, but im not sure about VAC Auth erros - at that time i wasn't clamping angles in AA if i remember correcty.

-- btw "hvh" in the name is a meme, should never be used for it in the current state, just take a look and maybe paste something from.

major features : aimbot - esp - chams - clan tag - aa ( bad ) - no rec/spread - send datagram ( fake latency ) - laser beans & imgui
the menu is kinda cool tho :)

-- update the offsets else it`s going to crash.
